<!-- INFORMATION -->
## Information

#### About
SpiderSense is my own personal fork/contiunation of the GameSense client player assistance utility mod for Minecraft. The original client was discontinued in May of 2021. I have decided to make it a personal project to update and add new features to GameSense because it was a really promising client, and I can't wait to see it developed to it's true potential.

#### Credits
***Check specific class files for full credits.***
