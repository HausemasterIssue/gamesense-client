**_SpiderSense is Discontinued, Please, do not bother with this client_**


SpiderSense is a **discontinued** continuation of the [GameSense](https://github.com/IUDevman/gamesense-client) utility mod for Minecraft 1.12.2

Credits for pasted/stolen code should have file credits. 

### Information

This client is an absolute mess and is filled with bad coding practices (pasting *cough* *cough*). There is code pasted/inspired from so many clients I can't even count. I am archiving the repository because I don't want to be known by this shitdump of a client. I regret everything in this client. I regret pasting/stealing code from clients instead of making it by myself. I regret portraying it as if it is some kind of actually good client. I regret being an ass. The truth is, I don't want to be known by this, and I don't want people to insult be because of this. It is a bad, pasted, and shit client that nobody should ever use or continue devloping. That's why it is fully discontinued and will **never** recieve any more updates. I am getting better at java, I am learning more about clients and trying to get away from pasting other people's code. **_Once again, Please do not use this, it is bad and I regret everything about this client, I have moved on and an working on other, better things_**.
