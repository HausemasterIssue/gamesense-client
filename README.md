SpiderSense is a continuation of the [GameSense](https://github.com/IUDevman/gamesense-client) utility mod for Minecraft 1.12.2

Credits for pasted/stolen code should have file credits. I (aesthetical) am in the process of cleaning up this mess and making it less pasted while HauseIssue learns java and gets better.

If you have any questions and or concerns, please [open an issue](https://github.com/HausemasterIssue/spidersense/issues/new)

## Building the Client

Download the code, and run the following commands in a terminal. You will need Java 8 installed.

If you are on Windows, the `./`  is not needed when running these commands/

```
./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build
```

Your jar file will be found in build/libs.
